# favorite-quotes

An example React application (with tests). The app lets you add quotes (author and quote text), and then like or remove them from your quote list. You can also change the color theme of your quote list.

## Accompanying Video Lessons

The video lessons that go along with this code are in [the "React Testing Cookbook" course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/react-testing-cookbook). Although the files are organized in this project in a cohesive way, each piece of code from the accompanying video lesson is meant to be a single, stand-alone cookbook "recipe" that can be applied to many other situations.

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
1. `npm test` to run tests
1. `npm run dev` and go to `localhost:8080` to run app and tests at the same time
